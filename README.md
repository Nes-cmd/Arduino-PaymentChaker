# Arduino-PaymentChaker

This project is for the purpose of cheking who is payed or not payed for particular event.
 If one event maker has an event, they can promot it online then the person who is registered and make payment online should be marked. This device tracks all the payments. Then at the day of the event if one is coming to attend or participate on the event, this device is used to pass the gate.
